In this step you will look at some of the configurable properties of audit logging. Then, you will demonstrate setting and unsetting one of these properties.

---
<p>
<span style="color:teal">**Note:**</span> 
All of these properties may be configured in `cassandra.yaml` or with *nodetool*. Properties configured in `cassandra.yaml` persist across server shutdownws. Properties configured with *nodetool* override preoperties configured in `cassandra.yaml.

# Configurable Properties

- `enabled`: This option enables/ disables audit log
- `logger`: Class name of the logger/ custom logger.
- `audit_logs_dir`: Auditlogs directory location, if not set, default to cassandra.logdir.audit or cassandra.logdir + /audit/
- `included_keyspaces`: Comma separated list of keyspaces to be included in audit log, default - includes all keyspaces
- `excluded_keyspaces`: Comma separated list of keyspaces to be excluded from audit log, default - excludes no keyspace except system, system_schema and system_virtual_schema
- `included_categories`: Comma separated list of Audit Log Categories to be included in audit log, default - includes all categories
- `excluded_categories`: Comma separated list of Audit Log Categories to be excluded from audit log, default - excludes no category
- `included_users`: Comma separated list of users to be included in audit log, default - includes all users
- `excluded_users`: Comma separated list of users to be excluded from audit log, default - excludes no user

In this example you will use the `excluded categories` property to exclude queries from the audit log.

Click to open *cqlsh*.
```
cqlsh
```{{execute}}

Select Elton John songs.
```
use music;
select * from songs where artist = 'Elton John';
```{{execute}}

Exit *cqlsh*.
```
exit
```{{execute}}

View the audit log.
```
auditlogviewer /var/log/cassandra/audit
```{{execute}}

You should see the most recent query for all Elton John songs.

Use *nodetool* to exclude queries from the audit logs.
```
nodetool enableauditlog --excluded-categories QUERY
```{{execute}}

Open *cqlsh*.
```
cqlsh
```{{execute}}

Select Paul Simon songs.
```
use music;
select * from songs where artist = 'Paul Simon';
```{{execute}}

Exit *cqlsh*.
```
exit
```{{execute}}

View the audit log.
```
auditlogviewer /var/log/cassandra/audit
```{{execute}}

You should see that the query for Paul Simon songs is not in the audit logs.

# Summary

In this step, you explored the configurable properties of audit logging. Next, you used *nodetool* to exclude *queries* from the audit logs. Then, you performed a query and used *auditlogviewer* to verify that the query was not logged.
